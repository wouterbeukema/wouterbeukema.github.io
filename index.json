I took a somewhat windy early career path, starting out as a wildlife manager and ecological consultant, after which I specialized in geoinformatics and biostatistics. My PhD work focused on disease ecology of the recently emerged fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in north-western Europe. I mostly study amphibians, preferably salamanders, and have a broad interest in herpetology. This website works as a small portfolio and contact page to easily connect you to my academic work, repositories, photography, and other projects.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://wouterbeukema.github.io/author/wouter-beukema/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/wouter-beukema/","section":"authors","summary":"I’m a recently-graduated ecologist with a PhD from Ghent University, Belgium.
