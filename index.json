[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I’m a recently-graduated ecologist with a PhD from Ghent University, Belgium. My background lies in geoinformatics, biostatistics, and ecological consultancy, while I picked up skills in ecophysiology during work for the Rui Nabeiro Biodiversity Chair at the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid. My PhD work focused on disease ecology of the recently emerged fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in north-western Europe. I mostly study amphibians, preferably salamanders, and have a broad interest in herpetology.\nThis website works as a small portfolio and contact page to easily connect you to my academic work, repositories, photography, and other projects.\n My publications can be accessed through my ResearchGate account. R packages and miscellaneous code can be found on GitHub. I\u0026rsquo;m using Instagram to showcase my photography. Check out our field guide to the amphibians and reptiles of Europe, which is also available in Dutch, French and Spanish.
